# ProjectOne-Group6
QauranScreen is a website based on your movie night. It searches for random movies when typed into the search bar. Also, the user can search for a alcholic beverage to make the night better. It displays both movie result and drink into the box areas after clicking submit.
# How to Use
The user can type a movie into the search bar and click submmit or just click the random button to display a randomized movie for the night. It will display on the bottom of the box area. The beverage box is basically the same thing but when a user types in a cocktail or press random it will display a alcholic drink with the ingredients.
# How it works
If something is searched in the moive bar then it will make a call OMDb and present the information from OMDb into the results section.
If a specific alcholic drink is searched then it will make a call to TheCocktailDb and that will present 
If the random button is clicked then it will display a randomized result into the result section.
